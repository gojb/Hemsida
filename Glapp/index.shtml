        How long can you bare to stay on the app?
<br>
        This app is very simple but entertaining. Every click earns one point. Every time you exit the app,
        bring up the control center or pull down the notification center, your points reset. The only reference
        you have is your top score. How far can you come?
<br>
        If you need to get in contact with the developer, send an email to gojbmail@gmail.com and I will help you
        from there
